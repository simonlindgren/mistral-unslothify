This method uses the open-source version of [Unsloth](https://unsloth.ai/), which democratises access to fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs through the method of LoRA ([Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)).


1. For access to GPU resources, this tutorial uses [`brev.dev`](https://brev.dev) . Login ☁️ there (Github login works) and use the 'Instances' tab to launch an instance. [Container mode; Brev Default; Choose your Compute resource; Note 💰 pricing (a few dollars per hour); Name instance --> Deploy].
2. Wait ☕️ until the compute instance's status is 'Running' and the container's status is 'Built'.  
3. Click  'Open Notebook' to enter into the JupyterLab environment.
4. Clone this present repo into your `brev` session: `git clone XXXXXX` and `cd` into that directory.
